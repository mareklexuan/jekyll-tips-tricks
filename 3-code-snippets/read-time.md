# Add "read time" to post

Add "read time" to your posts.

## Process

- Count words in the document.
- Divide them reading rate (for example 265 word per minute)
- Display the result.

## Code snippet

```Liquid
{% assign words = content | number_of_words %}
{% if words < 265 %} 1 min read
{% else %}
{{ words | divided_by:265 | plus: 1 }} min read
{% endif %}
```

## Notes

- For posts shorter than your reading rate, set fixed reading time as "1 minute".
- Liquid filter "divided_by:" rounds down to the nearest integer. To round up, just simply add +1 minute to read time.

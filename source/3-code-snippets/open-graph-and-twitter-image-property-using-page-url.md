# Automatic Open Graph and Twitter image property using page URL (without custom variable in Front Matter)

Make a formula that generates the path to the Open Graph and Twitter thumbnail image and fills it to the HTML meta tag using the page's URL, without using the Front Matter variable.

This code snipped is part of the **Implementing SEO tags** series, - [Part 2: Open Graph](https://github.com/mareklexuan/jekyll-tips-tricks/blob/main/source/2-tips-and-tricks/implementing-SEO-tags-open-graph.md)

## Process

If you followed my advice and you named your thumbnail images in a format consisting of a URL slug to the post for which the thumbnail is added, the "-og" suffix to distinguish the mage for Open Graph, and using one file extension (for example .jpg), you can create a Liquid formula to generate the URL to the thumbnail.

> Note: I recommend naming your thumbnail images in format "name-og", where "name" would be replaced by the URL slug to your page, and "-og" would signify that it is a image specifically for the Open Graph (as Twitter uses a different aspect ration and would require a separate thumbnail image, but more about in the next post), for example "blog-og.jpg" or "my-first-post-og.jpg".

To be able to create this formula, you need to have a consistent format of the images:

- Stored on the same domain
- Stored in the same folder
- The name of the image is URL slug to the page or post, with the "-og" or "-tw" suffix for Open Graph and Twitter images (or something else for each, but it needs to be consistent)
- Using same file format for all images, for example ".jpg"

Now you can combine them all into one formula - domain, folder location, page URL, suffix and file format. The biggest challenge is to transform the page URL into usable format matching the file format.

## Code snippet

This code example is for pages where posts are not slugified/sorted into folders (categories or tags, date etc.) and the URL format is set to have a trailing slash (slash at the end), for example `https://mydomain.com/blog/` or `https://mydomain.com/my-first-post/`. Then you can use this code snipped in your template:

```html
<meta property="og:image" content="https://mydomain.com/media/meta-images/{{ page.url | remove: "/" }}-og.jpg" />
```

## Notes

- Process for the Twitter image is the same, you just need to use slightly different HTML tag and use different suffix, for example "-tw".

```html
<meta name="twitter:image" content="https://mydomain.com/media/meta-images/{{ page.url | remove: "/" }}-tw.jpg" />
```

- It will not work for the homepage, as it has no URL slug. You need to create an exception for the homepage, something like "if it is a homepage (URL is /, empty etc.), use this specific image, otherwise use the formula".
- If you are using combination of the URL formats endings, for example with trailing slash and the ".html" suffix, you can add multiple filters to your Liquid tag, like `{{ page.url | remove: "/" | remove: ".html"}}`.
- If you are using the URL format which contains folders, like categories, tags, or dates (for example `https://mydomain.com/cars/2024/05/01/this-is-the-post.html`), you will need to adjust the formula, the file format, or image location. I like a simple structure, no sub-folders for posts and all meta images in one folder, but you might have a different approach. However, more complexity you add to the URL, more you then need to remove and more edge cases it can create with which you then need to deal with.

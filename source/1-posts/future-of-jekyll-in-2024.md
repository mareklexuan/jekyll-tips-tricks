# Future of Jekyll (in 2024)

When writing [the post about Jekyll and other static site generators][1], I started thinking about Jekyll's future. Is it still an active project? Is it still being developed and supported?

And I think it still is. I might no longer be the most active or the most popular static site generator out there, but still has its user base and people interested in its development.

In 2021, one of the core Jekyll developers said that the Jekyll is "is in frozen mode and permanent hiatus" and recommended users whose needs are not met, to move to Eleventy (which was build to replace Jekyll - you can read more about it in my post [Jekyll vs other static site generators][1]). But despite that, Jekyll still receives updates and continues forward.

It might have slowed down, but I don't think Jekyll is going anywhere. And I wouldn't definitely call it dead. It powers millions of GitHub pages and many use it for their web projects too. It is still the best introduction to the world of static site generators for any web dev newcomer. And even if the project stops being developed, as long as it satisfies your needs, it will still be available and you can still use it.

And worse case scenario you can take all your data and easily adapted other static site generator. Having all content in Markdown, Front Matter and YAML makes it easy to migrate to another tool and many of them use the same languages for content, just different engine for the rendering pages. You just edit a few settings and variables and you are set.

## Maturity

I think it is fair to say that Jekyll is a mature tool. It already has over a decade of development under its belt, it is in version 4.3.3, with version 4.4.0 being worked on, and version 5.0.0 in discussion. It is stable, can be used without issues (as far I, a basic user, can see), it is doing what it should do, having a decent amount of plugins, themes, documentation and other support content.

I think a good indicator of a tool's maturity is also a number of open issues. Jekyll has only 118 issues currently open, compared to other static site generators, some of which have over 2000 issues. And out of those 118, some are related to the documentation, not Jekyll itself, some are just spam and some are resolved but people didn't close them.

It might be considered a "feature-complete" tool and it is not necessarily a bad thing. It fulfils its purpose and there might not be the need to add more and more features. It is a simple static site generator that doesn't try to do everything and that is true to its name - it is static too. It doesn't change constantly and doesn't break your pages with another update.

I have read a nice comment about Jekyll that "if it does its job well enough, leave it alone. Don't fix something until it's broken". Another said that there are many simple programs that are more-or-less "done", that aren't constantly changing, and that is ok. Not everything has to constantly change and move forward, just for the sake of moving forward.

It is also a great comment about the current state of affairs and the constant race for something shinier. For better and faster things. We would do better if we would instead focus on what we can do with those tools, rather than if we have the best tool available.

## Slower progress

Some people might see the lack of releases as indication that the project is being abandoned, but I would disagree. It is still being worked on, just at a slower pace. You take your time and make sure you have done everything right and tested as much as you can think of, rather than release something quickly only to have to fix it immediately afterwards.

Every project simply works in a different way. Some release quickly and you end up with hundreds of releases. Some batch changes together and make a fewer, but bigger release. Jekyll is one of them. If you take a look at release history, you will see that in every bigger release, there are 100+ changes included in one release. I would rather have a stable project that gets updated one or twice a year, than getting updates twice a week.

## GitHub pages

Jekyll was created by GitHub (by its founder Tom Preston-Werner) and now powers GitHub pages, free hosting service for GitHub accounts, organisations and projects. It is Jekyll's primary use case and it brings a stream of new users who get to try and learn Jekyll.

## Version 5.0.0

Even though GitHub pages support Jekyll version 3.9.5, the Jekyll itself already has version 4.4.0 in the pipeline and there is an open discussion about another major version (Jekyll 5). Yes, the discussion is already for several years, but that shows it wants to keep improving and moving forward.

## Great tool for beginners

I think Jekyll is still a great gateway for newcomers to the static site generators. It was for me, it was simple enough for me to understand it, learn the basics and start learning more complex things as I go. I would still recommend it to anybody who would like to dip their toes into static site generators, especially if it is for simple personal projects.

## Support the community

Keeping Jekyll alive is also a role of every user and member of its community. As long as people participate, share their experience, report issues, mention ideas for improvements, and help other users with their problems, it will stay alive. I am trying to help by making this content and sharing what I have learned. Experienced users can help with issues and development, us beginner users can help other beginners to improve.

## There are some concerns

As I have described, I think Jekyll is a mature project and might be feature complete, but it still keeps going. What we can agree on is that its development has slowed down. Unfortunately that can be an indication for developers of themes and plugins to abandon their projects, in favour of something else, perhaps addons for other, more popular, static site generators.

Some of the plugins and code snippets I use, have already not been regularly maintained and don't work with the latest version of Jekyll. That is my main worry, that the plugins I use will stop working.

But as long as I don't need the new features, I don't have to update Jekyll. I can keep my current setup and work with it until it stops serving me. And recently, there has been an update after 5 years of inactivity for one of the plugins I use. So who knows. Open-source projects can sometimes work on very mysterious timelines.

But right now, I am not giving up on Jekyll. I like it and it serves the purpose I need it for, so there is no need to leave it for another tool.
